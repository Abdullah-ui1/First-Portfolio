              I was at this school from the ages of 11 to 19. wherein I
              completed my entire secondary and advanced education. Here I
              studied Physics, Mathematics and Biology (which I ended up
              hating!)

            <p>
              At Apple I used to be a technican repairing damaged products that
              would come in. This job was very eye opening as it was my first
              "proffesional" job per se.

              from various manufacturers as they would come in & ensure smooth
              operation for everyone.
